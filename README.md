# Introduction & Summary - Brian


`What is it?` -- Quiz Central is a Web Application that allows a user to take one of four personality quizzes. 

```python
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```

```python

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```

`Why this idea?` -- The Quiz Central concept was incepted by Kenny and Kevin mainly, in efforts to finally just decide on *something* to start working on, and give it our best shot. At the time, it seemed most suitable and relatively simple to develop quickly.

```python

# Overall Project Experience - Brian
 
> At the very start of forming the team, we decided to reference the grading rubric and structure our goals closely to the outlined factors.


Goals going into the project | Effort | Goal Met? 
---------------------------- | ------ | ---------
Well-prepared Presentation and equal participation | Good | Yes
Comprehensive & quality Documentation | Good | Yes
Project scope functionality - Application of course concepts and technology | Fair | Yes
Code Quality | Good | Yes
Innovation & Web Design | Decent | Yes, but maybe still room for improvement
Teamwork & Effective Team Communication | Good | Yes


> In the end, we made Quiz Central.
> 
> - A Web Application that can lighten the mood with some silly quizzes, which also proved to be a useful team collaboration exercise within Front End Engineering.
